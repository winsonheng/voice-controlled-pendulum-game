    Welcome to <i>Physic Chic</i>! This is a voice-dependent game that is sure to
    keep you entertained for hours! Before starting, do ensure that there is minimal
    background noise. Vary your voice tone and pitch to swing the pendulum at different
    frequencies, and tap to release the character from the pendulum. Your aim is to travel
    the furthest distance and collect as many points as possible. Good luck and have fun!
